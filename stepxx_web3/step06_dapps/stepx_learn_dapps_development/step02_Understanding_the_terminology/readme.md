## Understanding the Terminology

Before we dive into developing DApps, it's important to understand the key terminology used in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Here are some of the most important terms:

### Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions on a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, along with a timestamp and transaction data. The blockchain is used to ensure the immutability and transparency of the transaction records.

### Smart Contract

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist on a blockchain network and are automatically executed by the network when certain pre-defined conditions are met.

### Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate independently of a central bank. Some popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

### Decentralized Application (DApp)

A DApp is an application that runs on a decentralized blockchain network. It is designed to operate without any central authority, and all transactions are transparent and recorded on the blockchain.

### Ether

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for transaction fees and to incentivize miners to process transactions.

### Gas

Gas is a measure of the computational effort required to execute a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Each operation in a smart contract requires a certain amount of gas, which is paid for using Ether.

## Example

Here is an example of a smart contract that demonstrates the use of gas:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GasExample {
    uint public count;

    function increment(uint value) public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < value; i++) {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

In this smart contract, the `increment` function increments the `count` variable by a specified value. However, each iteration of the loop requires a certain amount of gas, and the amount of gas required increases with the value of `value`. This means that larger values of `value` will require more gas and therefore cost more in terms of transaction fees.

## Conclusion

In summary, understanding the key terminology used in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space is essential for developing DApps. In the following steps, we will explore the tools and technologies used for building DApps, including smart contracts, blockchain networks, and user interfaces.
