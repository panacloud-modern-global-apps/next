## Setting up Your Development Environment

To get started with building DApps using Next.js 13 and Ethers, Wagmi, and RainbowKit, you will need to set up your development environment. This involves installing the necessary software and libraries on your computer.

### Installing Next.js

First, you will need to install Next.js. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app
```

This will create a new Next.js project in your current directory.

### Installing Ethers

Next, you will need to install Ethers, which is the library we will use for interacting with the Ethereum network. You can install Ethers by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm i ethers
```

This will install the latest version of Ethers.

### Installing Wagmi

If you plan on using Wagmi for social features in your DApp, you will also need to install it. You can install Wagmi by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm i wagmi ethers@^5
```

This will install the latest version of Wagmi, as well as the required version of Ethers.

### Installing RainbowKit

Finally, you will need to install RainbowKit, which includes tools and libraries for building DApps on Ethereum. You can install RainbowKit by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
```

This will initialize a new RainbowKit project in your current directory.

## Example

Here is an example of how you might use these commands to set up your development environment:

```
# create a new Next.js project
npx create-next-app my-dapp

# navigate into the project directory
cd my-dapp

# install Ethers
npm i ethers

# install Wagmi
npm i wagmi ethers@^5

# initialize RainbowKit
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
```

This will create a new Next.js project called "my-dapp" and install the necessary libraries for building DApps using Next.js 13 and Ethers, Wagmi, and RainbowKit.

## Conclusion

In summary, setting up your development environment for building DApps using Next.js 13 and Ethers, Wagmi, and RainbowKit involves installing the necessary software and libraries on your computer. By following the steps outlined above, you can quickly set up a development environment for building powerful and scalable DApps on Ethereum.
