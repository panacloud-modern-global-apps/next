## Solidity Functions

Functions in Solidity are used to encapsulate and perform specific tasks within a smart contract. They can be called internally by other functions within the same contract, or externally by other contracts or external accounts on the Ethereum network.

### Function Declaration

Functions in Solidity are declared using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name and any input parameters in parentheses. For example:

```
function myFunction(uint256 myParam) public {
    // function code here
}
```

The `public` keyword indicates that the function can be called from other contracts or external accounts on the Ethereum network.

### Function Visibility

Functions in Solidity can have different levels of visibility, which determines who can call the function. The different levels of visibility are:

- `public`: can be called from anywhere
- `private`: can only be called from within the same contract
- `internal`: can only be called from within the same contract or from contracts that inherit from it
- `external`: can only be called from outside the contract

### Function Modifiers

Function modifiers in Solidity are used to modify the behavior of a function. They are declared using the `modifier` keyword, followed by the modifier name. For example:

```
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function.");
    _;
}
```

The `require()` statement in this modifier ensures that the function can only be called by the owner of the contract. The `_` placeholder indicates where the modified function code will be inserted.

### Example

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of functions, visibility, and modifiers in a Solidity contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function myFunction(uint256 myParam) public onlyOwner {
        // function code here
    }

    function myInternalFunction() internal {
        // function code here
    }

    function myExternalFunction() external {
        // function code here
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }
}
```

In this example, we've defined a Solidity contract called `MyContract` that includes several different types of functions. We've defined a `myFunction()` function that can only be called by the owner of the contract, an `myInternalFunction()` function that can only be called from within the same contract, and an `myExternalFunction()` function that can be called from outside the contract.

We've also defined a `onlyOwner()` modifier that ensures that certain functions can only be called by the owner of the contract.

By using functions, visibility, and modifiers, we can create smart contracts that are both modular and secure, ensuring that functions are called only by authorized parties and that data is manipulated correctly and consistently.
